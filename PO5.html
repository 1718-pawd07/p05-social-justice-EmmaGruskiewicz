	<h1>Our Mission</h1>
	<p class="p1">Generosity is a humanitarian organization dedicated to ending the clean water crisis in developing countries, one community at a time. A incredible non-profit organization. </p>
	
	<h1 class="clear"> Our Values </h1>
	<h3> Independence </h3>
		<p> We are a public interest organization that remains independent of corporate and government influence. We are funded fully through our members, individual donors, and foundation grants. </p>
	<h3> Democracy </h3>
		<p> We engage and mobilize citizens politically through person-to-person, on-the-ground organizing, educational campaigns and new media technologies. We believe political involvement is critical for holding governments accountable to their constituents and for creating policies that ensure a sustainable world with safe clean water. </p>
	<h3> Human Rights </h3>
		<p>Human rights include basic living essentials, like a fresh water source. Although the political will ensure that all people have adequate nutrition, drinking water is lacking. We are part of a growing global movement, fighting this injustice. </p>
	<h3> Sustainability </h3>
		<p><b>We believe in a sustainable future!</b></p>
		<p>One individual taking a stand, ensures access to essential resources for future generations while protecting the quality of our environment.</p>

	<h1 class="clear"> Clean Water is a Right!</h1>
	<img class="girl" src="girl.png" alt="" title="">
	<p> Clean drinking water is a human right, but even in the United States, people have to worry about whether their water is safe to drink, and whether they can afford it. This IS a <b>problem</b> we can solve! We need dedicated funding to keep our water systems up to date and affordable to protect our drinking water for generations to come. </p>
